# Production Environment Setup for Render

## üéØ Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Payment gateway was receiving `http://localhost:5173` URLs instead of production HTTPS URLs.
**Solution**: Updated hardcoded URLs to use `https://lawx.onrender.com` for production.

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Updated Payment Controller (`backend/controllers/payment.controller.js`)
- Fixed return URL: `https://lawx.onrender.com/premium/success?order_id={order_id}`
- Fixed webhook URL: `https://lawx.onrender.com/api/v1/payments/webhook`

### 2. Updated Payment Server (`payment-server.js`)
- Fixed return URL: `https://lawx.onrender.com/premium/success?order_id={order_id}`
- Fixed webhook URL: `https://lawx.onrender.com/api/v1/payments/webhook`

   - Initiate a payment
   - Check the browser console for payment URLs
   - Verify the return URL is HTTPS

3. **Check logs** for confirmation:
   ```bash
   üí≥ Payment order request: {

     notifyUrl: 'https://lawx.onrender.com/api/v1/payments/webhook'
   }
   ```

### If payment still fails:

1. **Check Render logs**:
   - Go to your service dashboard
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for payment-related errors

2. **Verify Cashfree settings**:
   - Ensure you're using **production** credentials
   - Check if your Cashfree account is verified for production
   - Verify webhook URLs in Cashfree dashboard

3. **Check environment variables**:
   - Ensure all required variables are set
   - Verify no trailing spaces or special characters
   - Confirm CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production

### Common Issues:
