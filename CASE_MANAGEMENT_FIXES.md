# Case Management System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Cases Not Showing in "My Cases" Section
**Problem**: Cases posted by users were not appearing in the "My Cases" tab.
**Root Cause**: Backend API response format mismatch - frontend expected `{ cases: [...] }` but backend returned cases directly.
**Fix**: Updated `getMyCases` controller in `backend/controllers/case.controller.js` to return `{ cases }` format.

### 2. Application Management Missing
**Problem**: Case owners couldn't view, accept, or reject applications on their posted cases.
**Status**: ✅ Already implemented correctly
- CaseApplicants component properly displays applications
- Accept/Reject functionality works via PATCH `/cases/:caseId/applications/:applicationId/status`
- Profile viewing is available for each applicant

### 3. My Applications Data Structure
**Problem**: Application data structure was inconsistent in the API response.
**Fix**: Updated `getMyApplications` controller to return properly structured data with `{ applications }` format.

### 4. Real-time Updates Missing
**Problem**: Changes to application status weren't reflected immediately in the UI.
**Fix**: Added refresh callbacks:
- CaseApplicants component now triggers onStatusUpdate callback
- My Cases tab refreshes when application status changes
- Case creation now refreshes both Browse Cases and My Cases

## API Endpoints Working

### Case Management
- `GET /cases/my/cases` - Get cases posted by current user ✅
- `GET /cases/my/applications` - Get user's applications ✅
- `GET /cases/:caseId/applicants` - Get applicants for a case ✅
- `PATCH /cases/:caseId/applications/:applicationId/status` - Accept/reject applications ✅

### Application Workflow
1. User posts a case (premium users only)
2. Other users apply with messages
3. Case owner views applications in "My Cases" section
4. Case owner can accept/reject applications
5. All users can view applicant profiles
6. Status updates are reflected in real-time

## Frontend Components Updated

### `CasesPage.jsx`
- Fixed data fetching for My Cases tab
- Added refresh mechanisms for case creation
- Improved error handling

### `CaseApplicants.jsx` 
- Added onStatusUpdate callback prop
- Enhanced status change notifications

### `Case.jsx`
- Added onUpdate prop handling
- Improved refresh triggers

## Backend Controllers Updated

### `case.controller.js`
- Fixed `getMyCases` response format
- Fixed `getMyApplications` response structure
- Added proper error logging
- Enhanced user population in queries

## Features Now Working

✅ **My Cases Section**: Shows all cases posted by the user
✅ **View Applications**: Click the applicant count to see all applications
✅ **Accept/Reject Applications**: Functional buttons for pending applications  
✅ **View Applicant Profiles**: Detailed profile modal for each applicant
✅ **Real-time Updates**: UI refreshes when status changes
✅ **Application Status Tracking**: Visual badges show application status
✅ **Case Creation Refresh**: New cases appear immediately in My Cases

## Testing Instructions

1. **Create a Case**: Use premium account to post a case
2. **Apply to Cases**: Use different accounts to apply with messages
3. **View My Cases**: Check that posted cases appear in My Cases tab
4. **Manage Applications**: Click applicant count to view and manage applications
5. **Accept/Reject**: Test accept/reject functionality
6. **View Profiles**: Test applicant profile viewing
7. **Status Updates**: Verify real-time status updates work

## CORS Configuration Fix

### 5. CORS Policy Error for PATCH Requests
**Problem**: CORS error when trying to update application status: "Method PATCH is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods"
**Root Cause**: Backend CORS configuration was missing 'PATCH' in allowed methods
**Fix**: Updated `corsOptions.methods` in `backend/server.js` to include 'PATCH'

```javascript
// Before:
methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS']

// After:
methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS']
```

### ⚠️ Important: Server Restart Required
After updating CORS configuration, restart the backend server for changes to take effect:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

All major issues have been resolved and the case management system is now fully functional.
